The questionnaire includes the relevant medical information that clinicans quickly sift through before assessing the patient themselves. We've simulated the results of this questionnaire and included a plethora of initial features. The core features revolve around symptomology, with an associated severity score, patient demographics, vitals, and other key components faciltating high-quality medical care. "
